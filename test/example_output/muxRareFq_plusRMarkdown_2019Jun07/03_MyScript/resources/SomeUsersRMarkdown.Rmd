## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
getModOutputFiles <- function(modName){
  modDir = dir("../../", modName)
  files=dir(paste0(c("../../",modDir, "/output/"),collapse=""), ".f*q")
  files=paste0("../../", modDir , "/output/", files)
  return(files)
}

getNumReads <- function(filePath){
  cmd=paste0(c("< ", filePath, " wc -l" ), collapse="")
  lines=system(cmd, intern=TRUE)
  numLines = trimws(lines)
  reads = as.numeric(numLines) / 4
  return(reads)
}
```

## Use Pipeline Files

This script assumes that it is called sometime after the RarefySeqs module and that the RarefySeqs module was called after SeqFileValidator

Get the output files from the two modules.
```{r}
seqFileVal.files = getModOutputFiles( "SeqFileValidator" )
sfv.reads = sapply(seqFileVal.files, getNumReads)

rarify.files = getModOutputFiles( "RarefySeqs" )
rfy.reads = sapply(rarify.files, getNumReads)
```

## Include Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
boxplot(sfv.reads, rfy.reads, las=1, 
        col = c("coral", "dodgerblue3"), 
        names = c("before", "after"),
        ylab="reads per file")
title("Rarification")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Use in-line code
As shown above, the mean reads per file before running the rarifyer was about **`r mean(sfv.reads)`**.  After running the rarifier, the mean was about **`r mean(rfy.reads)`**.
