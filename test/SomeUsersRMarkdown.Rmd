## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Use Pipeline Files

This script assumes that it is called sometime after the RarefySeqs module and that the RarefySeqs module was called after SeqFileValidator
```{r}
getNumReads <- function(filePath){
  cmd=paste0(c("< ", filePath, " wc -l" ), collapse="")
  lines=system(cmd, intern=TRUE)
  numLines = trimws(lines)
  reads = as.numeric(numLines) / 4
  return(reads)
}

getModOutputFiles <- function(modName){
  modDir = dir("../../", modName)
  files=dir(paste0(c("../../",modDir, "/output/"),collapse=""), ".f")
  files=paste0("../../", modDir , "/output/", files)
  return(files)
}
```

Get the output files from the two modules.
```{r}
seqFileVal.files = getModOutputFiles( "SeqFileValidator" )
sfv.reads = sapply(seqFileVal.files, getNumReads)

rarify.files = getModOutputFiles( "RarefySeqs" )
rfy.reads = sapply(rarify.files, getNumReads)
```

Plot the results:
```{r}
boxplot(sfv.reads, rfy.reads, las=1, 
        col = c("coral", "dodgerblue3"), 
        names = c("before", "after"),
        ylab="reads per file")
title("Rarification")
```

As shown above, the mean reads per file before running the rarifyer was about `r mean(sfv.reads)`.  After running the rarifier, the mean was about `r mean(rfy.reads)`.
